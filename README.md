# 100DaysofDSAlgo

This is a part of my effort to get myself better at Recursion,Backtracking and Dynamic Programming primarily. I have started with solving the problems from Cracking the Coding Interview. I will continue to explore more interesting problems , depending on how comfortable I get with these topics after going through all the problem statements from CTCI.

I will be uploading all the approaches ranging from the naive to the most efficient approach that comes to my mind. Better approaches to a solution are most welcome.

To make others understand the approach , I have sprinkled some comments onto the code.

If you think there is still a better approach to a problem , you can always open up issues or create a pull request!

Cheers!
